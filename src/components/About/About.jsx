        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am self-taught frontend developer based near Munich / Germany. My
          background is in sales and digital marketing (especially content
          marketing and SEO).
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last 10+ years I have been living in Thailand where I built
          and ran several niche businesses. Among them an online travel booking
          site in Thailand, a destination wedding agency and a few digital
          courses and products. I also worked with clients as a SEO consultant
          and SEO project manager for an agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          While working on my own projects as well as working with clients I
          realized that I actually enjoyed building websites much more than
          marketing them, but that also my knowledge was way too limited. And so
          my journey into web development began.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last year or so I have taken several courses and build small
          projects in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. More recently I started
          to learn React, Redux and got really excited about Jamstack
          architecture.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment I am improving my skills during a remote trainee program
          at Integrify, a Finnish Software Company, where I am learning
          Fullstack Webdevelopment with the MERN stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am ready to join my first full time roll as a Frontend Developer in
          2022 and continue learning and growing as a developer.
